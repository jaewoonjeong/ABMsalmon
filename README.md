# ABMsalmon

This repository contains code used in the following paper. 

Jaewoon Jeong and Gregor McEwan. **Wild salmon migration routes influence sea lice infestations: An agent-based model predicting farm-related infestations on juvenile salmon**

All code contained within this repository is run with R. 

'Migration Model & Infestation Model.R' and 'Sensitivity Analysis.R' are using 'Raster map.R' and 'MigrationFunction.R' as their sources. 'Migration Model & Infestation Model.R' includes the code for Figures 4, 5, and 6, and 'Sensitivity Analysis.R' includes the code for Figure 7. The code for the figures of maps was not included due to their large file size.
